Vim with Rspec

INSTALL
-------
This plugin make easy to run the spec command inside Vim. You need Hpricot (http://wiki.github.com/why/hpricot) 
OR xsltproc (http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html) and grep (http://www.gnu.org/software/grep) to use it.
Hpricot takes precedence over xsltproc. 
There are four files on the package: the Vim script, the Ruby script, the XSL file and the syntax file.

To install, unpack the files on your ~/.vim directory and source it to make it available. You
can also use the Makefile to install the files, just type:
make install

USAGE
-----
There are two commands available: 

You can run RunSpec and spec will run with the current file (if it's a *_spec.rb file) 
You can run RunSpecs and spec will run with all the files inside the spec directory. 

After some of the commands above runs, it will open a new window with the result, where you can click on the error 
lines where there's a file path with the line number and it will open on a new window, moving the cursor to the 
line where the error is.

Enhancements by @skwp (Yan Pritzker)
-----
 * Improved colors (for Solarized, specifically)
 * Run in same window, do not create a new window for every run
 * When browsing errors in rspec window, hitting enter takes you to the code in other split (do not create new window)
 * Ability to hit 'n' in the rspec output to go to the next error (and the corresponding code in the split)
 * Unescape html so that brackets in stacktraces are correctly displayed

Suggested Key Mappings
-----
Run using Cmd-Shift-R:

  map <D-R> :RunSpec<cr>
