Vim with Rspec 2.x

NOTE: This version is drastically different from the original taq/vim-rspec
fork due to a large refactoring of the main codebase into a modularized
form. If you have an old fork with custom changes, you may want to look
at what's been done here.

INSTALL
-------
 * Requires: gem install hpricot
 * Install with pathogen: clone/submodule into vim/bundle

TODO
-------
 * Phase out support for xslt. This code is doing too much right now. The ruby transform is fine.
 * Add support for running single it-blocks
 * Support for rspec2 (longer term, as I currently don't use it myself)
 * Custom paths for RunSpecs (e.g. fast_specs dir)

USAGE
-----
 * :RunSpec for current file or :RunSpecs for all files in spec dir
 * A split will open at the bottom. You can hit 'n' to go to the next error, or navigate to it and hit Enter to go to the line in the file.

Enhancements by @skwp (Yan Pritzker)
-----
 * Failures and Success is now displayed prominently at the top in green or red
 * Improved colors (for Solarized, specifically)
 * Run in same window, do not create a new window for every run
 * When browsing errors in rspec window, hitting enter takes you to the code in other split (do not create new window)
 * Ability to hit 'n' in the rspec output to go to the next error (and the corresponding code in the split)
 * Unescape html so that brackets in stacktraces are correctly displayed

Suggested Key Mappings
-----
Run using Cmd-Shift-R:

  map <D-R> :RunSpec<cr>
